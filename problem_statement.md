 Many clothing businesses in my local area face significant challenges in effectively managing
 their inventory. The current manual inventory management systems are not only time-consuming
 but also prone to errors, leading to frequent stockouts or overstocking situations. These issues
 can have severe consequences, including missed sales opportunities, dissatisfied customers, and
 increased costs for the business.
 
 The existing inventory management systems often rely on manual data entry and paper-based
 records, making it difficult to track inventory accurately and efficiently. Moreover, these systems
 struggle to account for real-time sales and returns, resulting in inaccurate information on product
 availability and hindering the decision-making process for both customers and retail store
 Employees.
 
 The objective of this project is to develop a database management system that addresses these
 inventory management challenges and improves operational efficiency for clothing businesses.
 The proposed solution aims to automate inventory tracking using SQL and Python, providing a
 real-time view of stock levels and precise information on the availability of each clothing item.
 The system's features include automatic updating of stock levels based on sales and returns,
 ensuring that inventory records are always up to date. The database will be updated immediately
 after a sale is made or an item is returned. The system will feature an intuitive and user-friendly
 interface developed with the Tkinter Python library. This interface will allow users to easily
 navigate through the system, and perform tasks efficiently.
 
 By automating inventory tracking, and providing accurate and up-to-date information, the project
 aims to enhance sales, reduce costs, and optimize overall performance for clothing businesses in
 my local area.
